title: Death of a SPAlesman
---

This is a presentation I gave to a local meetup group about the "death" of single page apps. As I have worked on single page apps for 10 years, this topic is relevant to me and the work I will do in the future. The topic was inspired by a tweet from a prominent developer.

In this presentation, I discussed the challenges of single page apps, and how the front end development culture has changed in the 10 years I've been working in this space. I also shared my thoughts on the future of web development, and how HTMX can give us many of the benefits of SPAs while being much simpler to build with.
